# scaling-octo-broccoli
Filled with broccoli and dreams which are, to be honest, very much the same.

I was told to introduce myself in the GitHub introductory tutorial, so hi! My name is Mitzy, and I'm trying to learn how to code and pick locks so that I may one day be able to take over the world. Did you know that you only need these two skills alone to be a dominator of the world? I'm starting to see why no one has truly mastered world domination just yet. Both skills are quite hard to master.

I'm listening to the original sountrack of the game "Donut County". It helps me get into the world-dominating mood. Very nice. What are you listening to now? Whatever it is, I hope it gets you into a good mood.

Thank you for reading this. Have some sweet broccoli tonight.
